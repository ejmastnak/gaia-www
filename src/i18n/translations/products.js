Our apple juice is pressed in small batches each fall from apples grown in our tall-trunk meadow orchards.
Our juice is intentionally unfiltered to preserve body and flavor, which, together with the diverse combination of heirloom varieties that go into our juice, gives it a depth of flavor and richness not found in commercial products.

Our production of apple cider vinegar goes hand in hand with the pressing of apple juice each fall—we make our vinegar from the pulp and residual juice left over from the pressing process.
The relatively low sugar level and high concentration of apple solids in the raw ingredients, together with a slow fermentation all winter long, gives our vinegar a smoothness, gentleness, and complexity not found in conventional vinegar made only from fermented apple juice.

      Saint John's Wort oil is a traditional Slovene herbal product made from the flowers of the Saint John's Wort plant.
      It is used to sooth and heal damaged skin after minor burns, to improve circulation at the skin surface, and as a luxurious massage oil.
      We make our oil by steeping St. John's Wort flowers—hand-picked from meadows on our mountain pastures—in cold-pressed olive oil over multiple weeks, and then filtering out the resulting crimson-colored oil.
