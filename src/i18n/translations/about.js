But for lack of a younger generation to take over, the farm gradually fell into disrepair in the 2000s, with only the old-growth orchards of tall-trunk fruit trees remaining.
Dominik, the last remaining member of the once-strong family, kept up small-scale farming while his health allowed, selling apple juice, cider vinegar, and herbal products while operating as Center Gaia d.o.o.
But worsening health problems forced him to scale down production and eventually sell the property in 2023, with production and business pretty much fallow.`,

Plowing and re-planting fallow fields, repairing neglected buildings, and planting a new generation of fruit trees, reviving business.
Maintaining tradition of apple products, heirloom varieties, small scale production, blah blah.
Maintain cultivation of land and tradition of farming, blah blah.
For what it's worth, son also manages the bookkeeping, accounting, sales, graphic design, and website in-house.`,
