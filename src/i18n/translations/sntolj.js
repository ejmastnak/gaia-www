Our farm and St. John's Wort are completely free of pesticides, herbicides, and all other synthetic agrochemicals, and the flowers are steeped in organic extra virgin olive oil.
So although we don't yet have an official certification, our St. John's Wort oil is effectively BIO all but in name.

  production: [
    {
      en: `
We make our oil from St. John's Wort flowers hand-picked from meadows on our mountain pastures.
The flowers are steeped in organic extra-virgin olive oil and left to macerate over a period of 4-6 weeks, during which the active compounds in the St. John's Wort flowers infuse into the carrier oil, and the hypericin in the flowers leaves the oil with a distinctive, deep crimson color.
