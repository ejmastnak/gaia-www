    en: `Meadow orchards are a traditional agroforestry system characterized by high-growing, old-growth fruit trees scattered sparsely and irregularly throughout a grassland understory. In the name "tall-trunk meadow orchard", the meadow refers to the grassland understory, orchard to the fruit trees, and "tall-trunk" to the tree's high-growing, tall trunks (in contrast to the short trees found in conventional intensive orchards).`,
